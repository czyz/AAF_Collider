# AAF_Collider
A media copying python script which takes an AAF of a Media Composer sequence as input, and copies all source MXF files referenced in it to a folder

## Usage:

```% AAF_Collider_v4.py MySequence.aaf```

## Expected Outcome:
This script uses the pyaaf2 module to parse an AAF files and collect the paths of all source MXF files referenced in a sequence, and then it copies those files into a folder on the desktop named for the sequence. It will also make a list of any missing media and write that to a text file in that same folder.

It has been tested in a collaborative environment, with AAF files exported using the "Link to (Don't Export) Media" setting. When source media are located on a Nexis or other network filesystem, the references to those locations in the AAF all start with file://nexispro/ or file://IP_Address/. In order to make the source locations function for copying from the Unix shell, the script replaces the URL portion of the path with "/Volumes/". This works on macOS, but other logic may be required for other computing platforms. 

### Why the name?
This script _sucks_ the source media references out of an AAF, and the Large Hadron Collider is the world's largest *vacuum*. Soâ€¦ yeah it's a stretch but I didn't want to name it "My copy of Automatic Duck Media Copy no longer runs so I threw this together to fill a need".
